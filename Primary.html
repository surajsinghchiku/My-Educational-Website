    <h1>About Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>1. Privacy Policy Summary</h3>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the U.S. Department of Education (ED) website and reviewing our privacy policy. 
        Our policy is simple: We collect 
        no personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us. We do not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party.

        Some of our web pages (such as online publication order forms, conference and training registration forms, web discussion forums) let you voluntarily submit personal information. In those cases, we will provide a specific notice before you begin submitting any personal information, explaining how your information will be safeguarded.
        
        If you want to know more about how we record non-personal information about your visit or how we use information that you voluntarily submit, read on.</p>
        <h3>2. Non-personal Information We Record</h3>
        <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, our website's operating system will automatically record some general information about your visit.

            During your visit, our web operating system will record:
        
        <P>1. The Internet domain for your Internet service, such as "xcompany.com" or "xcompany.net" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a college or university domain.</P>
        <P>2. The type of browser (such as "Netscape version X" or "Internet Explorer version X") that you are using.</P>
        <P>3. The type of operating system that you use (such as Macintosh, Unix, or Windows).</P>
        <p>4. The date and time you visit our site, and the web pages that you visit on our site.</p>
        <p>5.The address of the previous website you were visiting, if you linked to us from another website.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
        <p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-10-22: Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies allows Federal Agencies to use sessions and persistent cookies.‚Äù</p>
        
    <p>When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. Placing cookie text allows websites to "remember" visitors' preferences, surfing patterns and behavior while they are connected.

        The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from ED.gov Web pages only collect information about your browser's visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.
        
        There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.
        
        Session Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1-Single Session." The Guidance states, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."
        
        Persistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies for two reasons: 1) to enable Google's Universal Analytics to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site, and 2) to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey.</p>
